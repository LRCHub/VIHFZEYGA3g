Come closer,
Don't be afraid
It's ok,
I'm here

Who's there when you need a friend
To let you know
It will be all right
When you need a helping hand
Who loves you baby
Hug and squeeze you tight

Count on me darling

Who's the one who holds you tight
Loves you late at night
When you're all alone
Who's the one who makes your heart go crazy baby
When you're on the phone

Count on me darling
Yeah
Count on me darling

Oh what more can i do?
Oh i'm so in love with you now baby
I'll do anything

So count on me darling
Count on me darling

No more walking all alone
All alone for what
Do you know girl
We can be happy without money
Cos that's what love's about

Count on me darling
When you need a friend
Count on me darling

Oh girl you know my love is true
You can count on me
I'll be there

And every time you do
You'll never have to say yes
And when you're tired of the pain

Count on me darling
Count on me darling

Touch me, feel my heart beat,
Kiss me, oh so sweet

Count on me darling
When you need a friend
Count on me darling

You can count on me
You can count on me
I'll be there
You can count on me
You can count on me
I'll be there
I want you to know
